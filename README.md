## Overview
This project focuses on migrating historical data to a new e-commerce platform that operates with a different data structure. The goal was to clean, transform, and adapt historical data using Python and Pandas, ensuring a seamless transition between systems.This solution ensures data integrity and compatibility with the new platform, optimizing performance and ensuring stakeholders have access to actionable data.

## Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy
Development Tools: Jupyter Notebooks
Version Control: Git

## Problem Statement
When migrating data between two e-commerce platforms with different structures, inconsistencies and formatting issues can arise. Maintaining data accuracy and compatibility is crucial to prevent business disruptions. This project addresses the challenge of transforming historical data into a structure compatible with the new system while preserving critical information.

## Solution
The migration process was handled through Python and Pandas. The steps involved:

- Data Import: Imported the historical data from the old system.
- Data Cleaning: Handled inconsistencies such as missing or duplicate entries and ensured all fields were correct.
- Data Transformation: Reformatted the data to match the structure required by the new e-commerce platform.
- Data Export: Saved the cleaned and transformed data in a format ready for import into the new platform.
This step-by-step transformation ensures that data remains clean, accurate, and usable, enabling a smooth transition without interruptions.

## Features
- Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and corrected inconsistencies.
- Data Transformation: Reformatted and normalized the data to fit the structure of the new e-commerce platform.
- Data Integrity: Ensured no loss of critical information during the migration process.
- Compatibility: Prepared data to be fully compatible with the new platformâ€™s requirements.
